            <p>Finding the joy once stolen was no easy task. 
                But we must never believe that other peoples actions are our 
            defining point. Life was not given to me by even one of my perpetrators, it was God who blessed me to be here.
        Therefore, the wrongs done to me in my life would not live in me because of them. Finding my own light in the darkness of my past was the challenge
    I was born to accomplish and share. And, for this reason, I am sharing my life experiences on this website
with the hope that it will help someone to understand that they too can find their joy by living through the pain.</p>
<p>Hear me LOUD,and hear me CLEAR, child molestation or sex trafficking does not make you dirty,
    it does not make God hate you or deny you, and it is NOT your fault. Child molestation or sex trafficking is exactly that, the molestation or sexual trafficking of an innocent person unable to defend themselves or even define why they are being tortured.
     I should know,
     i was a child molested and sex trafficked by the one person that is known to be a protector, my Mother.<p> 

     </p>
    I was sold by my mother to men that were shopping for innocense and the opportunity to defile it. And she was eager to accept payment for me no matter what the cost I would have to pay physically, mentally or emotionally. But now, I am on the other side of that spectrum,
    I live in control of my own body, thoughts, and desires. This is the story of my life that was once stolen, and how i took it back by living through the pain.<p>

    </p> I live with the understanding that nothing was lost and nor was my pain in vain. I realize that 
    broken people do broken things to help themselves feel fixed. Its simular to a drug addict seeking their next hit, except they are, for the most part, hurting themselves. 
     But, unlike the drug addict the perophiles fix comes from seeking out and hurting small innocent defenceless human prey.
       And it's this demented thinking that makes it criminal. How can one believe if they are broken that the fracturing or breaking of another person will make them 
        whole and fixed.<p>
    </p> The pedophile desires to hurt babies, children, and the most innocent and helpless in society.
     Does that make you a victim, yes, their victim.
    But, does that make you a victim within yourself? No, and it cannot if you don't allow it to. It was not your desire or choice, so you have
    no reason to embrace the actions of anyone that hurts you. We were their victims, but you are not a victim.
    Tell your story, tell it to many, you are not guilty of any wrong doings. Let their names and actions live in infamy. 
    Remember, you are not the keeper of their horrific crimes committed on you, don't let it become your secret. Again, tell it.

</p> We are strong, and we are courageous,
 we are not beholden to any of our perpetrators, not even our mother's, father's, aunt's, uncle's, sister's, brother's, or cousin's if they hurt us.
 Tell it, tell is all and let them have their guilt, that shame does not belong to you, so do NOT carry it.
    We get up just like the person sitting to our right or our left. We dress, eat, laugh, think, we are not victims within, and now that we are adults
    make them responsible while clearing your mind. I prayed, cried, screamed, 
    sought counseling, and loved, yes i love all that i can, from gold fish to trees to homeless people and welltodoers, I love with my whole heart and i refuse to stop caring because, 
    i am not broken.

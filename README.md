Wow, I'm talking about me! This is a task I'd rather not embark upon but Morgan, you ask for this, lol...
I'm an old lady with double bridges that cost over six thousand dollars but, I can chew my food, so; they were worth it.
I have four children that are all adults now, so i actually have four adults who  still remind me that, they are my children. 
And, although thats not always a good thing, I work with it.
I love life and if I dont get something right, I see that as the acroymn i made up 'really interesting gifts help teach.' 
So, we can always improve or try something new and thats the joy of life and learning, to me.
Now, moving on to the more indepth side of me. I am a surviver of child sex trafficing and  spousal abuse. And, it is my belief that many of the difficulties i've encountered in life have been a compounded piggyback effect from a lack of learning what good or fair treatment is from an early age. Therefore, it took me a long time to understand and overcome my emotional attachments to being treated badly. Many people do not understand that 97.5% of individuals who have been abused will return to an abusive situation, at the least, five times during their lifetime, if not more. 
However, there is a positive way out and for me it was through my faith, late in life education and counseling. 
Someday, in the mist of all of my plans, i know i will start a non-profit organization titled, 'WWNBA-We Will Not Be Abused.' In closing, one thing that i have learned is that hardships or difficult times could not define me. They reminded me that the creativity, drive and desire in me would allow me, in spite of it all, to define myself as who i actually see me as being, a whole and complete woman filled with love, compassion and determination.

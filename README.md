Wow, I'm talking about me! This is a task I'd rather not embark upon but you Morgan as ask for this, lol...
I'm an old lady with double bridges that cost over six thousand dollars but, i can chew my food; so, they were worth it.
I have four children that are all adults now, so i actually have four adults that sometimes still remind me of the children i had. 
And thats not always a good thing, but i work with it.
I love life and if I dont get something right, I see that as the acroymn i made up that 'really interesting gifts help teach.' 
So, we can always improve or try something new and thats the joy of life and learning, to me.

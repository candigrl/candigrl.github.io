                <This european website seems to have hit all the marks for building a user friendly website. It opens to information that allows one to select a genre without having to search through hidden sidebars or sign-in stratagies for feeding personal information before viewing what the purpose of the website is for, or has to offer.
                The unity and balance are clear and visually articulate making it an easy image read and then word find. This type of design is intended for almost anyone.
                The emphasis on their product line are clear and conceptually well organized in a user friendly format. There is a variety of heading lists that open to well organized feeds from which to select.
                Additionally, the color contrast of the page gives a visual flow  meant to capture its audience sort of like a properly designed store window display of old.
                Then you have the water which represents movement, and the couple in near matching patterns with the option of jeans, tennis shoes, shirt and jacket as the first line of inclusion to complete the look of thaie outfits.></This>

                 <There is a contrast of colors to bring the eye to the main or only character that represents the title in the disassociative manner it was meant to do. The circles on circles eye on the oatmeal character with the black smiling mouth is certainly meant to hypnotise in a fun but manancing manner. This imagery unites and balances the main emphasis of the website.
                 With the variety of cartoon messages and movement through the sight show a clearly thoughout pattern for fun and sickly twisted humour for its readers.></There>

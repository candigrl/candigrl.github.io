                <h1>No Need For Shame</h1>

              <p>It's sometimes hard to feel like you've done nothing wrong, or that the world doesn't see the dirt you think you wear from the pain you carry inside.
              But no one actually sees it and they only know your pain exist if you talk about it, and talk about it you should. 
               The abused are often afraid that if you tell what they have been through that they will somehow turn pain into being their fault. I realized early on when talking about it that some of that fear comes from the judgement of others and how they can sometime make a victim beleive that it is their own fault.
               But again i ask you to remember, many other victims are not ready to release their shame and pain.
               
               Abuse, assault, rape, sexual abuse, sex slavery, emotional, physical or any other form of mistreatment and abuse is not your fault so there is no need for shame.
               I am a victim of physical, mental, emotional and sexual abuse, yes i have the big four. Some people carry less but many carry more. Sometimes I feel like one of the lucky one, not every kind of abuse has touched my soul, but even if it has we must still carry on.
               We must understand that the guilt I carry and shame is not our own and we should not own it.
               talking about it and telling the names or your perpetrator I have found a useful tool in releasing the hurt, guilt and pain. if someone doesnt want to listen remember, they too may have been abused but are not ready to release their attachment to what they have been through.
